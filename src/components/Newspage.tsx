            The Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Rashidi Adewolu Ladoja has implored the
            Federal Government to help solve the ecological problems in Ibadan.
            The first class monarch made this plea today in Abuja when he visited
            the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Dr George Akume.
            In a release signed by his Media Aide, Adeola Oloko, the Olubadan
            acknowledged the previous interventions of the Federal Government and
            World Bank on Ogunpa channelisation programme.
            The royal father, however, added that Ogunpa ecological problem
            gained more prominence because the areas affected are elitist areas
            stretching from Mokola, Ekotedo, Ogunpa, Oke Ado to Molete.
          </p>

            He therefore requested the assistance of the Federal Government to help solve the
            ecological problems threatening the down-troddenpeople
            living around Oranyan, Kudeti Agbongbon Area and some other parts of city
            that have not been in the spotlight due to no fault on some other parts of city
            that have not been in the spotlight due to no fault of theirs.

            the Federal Government scribe, Dr George Akume ssid he was not surprised that Kabiyesi
            Olubadan could come all the way from Ibadan to Abuja to bring the attention of the
            Federal Government to the plight of his people, adding that this is why Olubadan 
            has won a wide perspective of affection.

            Oba Ladoja was accompanied by Senator Fatai Buhari (Oyo North) and
